Message box top, middle and bottom are saved under "Miscellaneous components".

Also in that folder is an image called "message_box_fade_screen" - this is a semi transparent black image that fades out the screen behind the message box. I've used a small image to reduce file size, but it will stretch to fit the screen with no problems.

There's an example of the fade screen in use in the "Screen mock ups" file.


Buttons

Some message boxes require one button (ok). There is a large "ok" button in the button folder that you can use.

Some message boxes require two buttons (ok, cancel). The large buttons will not fit; there are smaller buttons for these messages, "small_ok" and "small_cancel".

For consitency, you may use the smaller buttons for all message boxes?
